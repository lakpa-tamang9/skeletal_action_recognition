# Realtime Skeleton based Action Recognition using Spatio-temporal Graph Convolutional Networks

A simplified action recognition project to detect performed dance actions in real time. 

## Usage
### 1. Prepare and extract data
The first step to realizing action recognition is to collect the desired data. This can be done by repeatedly recording the actions of multiple persons and creating a large sample of dataset. You can also use opensource datasets or create your own custom dataset consisting of the any type of actions.
### 2. Train the model
### 3. Perform real time recognition
